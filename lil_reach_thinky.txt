REACH

Requires: 
	City
	

Reach Contains:

	Position (x,y)
	Owner (city.name)
	Color (City.color) <-- this might get complicated for the merge cities
	
	


Reach needs to:
	Add new reach around self (int number reach, direction city.sentiment.direction)
	Remove reach (position x,y)
	Modify reach (position x+y, new city.name)



Modifiers:
	reach direction down to city sentiment - do in city class?
	number reach down to game events - need a shock flag somewhere: if(shocked) no new reach UNLESS psycho --> gets 2.
